TUIO C# LIBRARY AND EXAMPLES
----------------------------
Copyright (c) 2005-2009 Martin Kaltenbrunner <mkalten@iua.upf.edu>
This software is part of reacTIVision, an open source fiducial
tracking and multi-touch framework based on computer vision. 

http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/

Demo Applications:
------------------
This package contains two demo applications which are able
to receive TUIO messages from any TUIO enable tracker.

* TuioDump prints the TUIO events directly to the concole
* TuioDemo draws the object and cursor state on the screen

You can use these demo applications for debugging purposes, 
or use them as a starting point for the development of your own
C# applications implementing the TUIO protocol. Please refer to
the source code of the both examples and the following section.

Pressing F1 will toggle FullScreen mode with the TuioDemo,
pressing ESC or closing the Window will end the application.
Hitting the V key will print the TUIO events to the console.

Keep in mind to make your graphics scalable for the varying
screen and window resolutions. A reasonable TUIO application
will run in fullscreen mode, although the windowed mode might
be useful for debugging purposes or working with the Simulator.

For your convenience this example contains a monodevelop project.

Application Programming Interface:
----------------------------------
First you  need to create an instance of TuioClient. This class 
is listening to TUIO messages on the specified port and generates
higher level messages based on the object events.

Your application needs to implement the TuioListener interface,
and has to be added to the TuioClient in order to receive messages.

	"public class MyApplication : TuioListener"

A simple code snippet for setting up a TUIO session:

	MyApplication app = new MyApplication();
	TuioClient client = new TuioClient();
	client.addTuioListener(app);
	client.start();

A TuioListener needs to implement the following methods:

* addTuioObject(TuioObject tobj):
  this is called when an object becomes visible
* removeTuioObject(TuioObject tobj):
  an object was removed from the table
* updateTuioObject(TuioObject tobj):
  and object was moved on the table surface
* addTuioCursor(TuioCursor tcur):
  this is called when a new cursor is detected
* removeTuioCursor(TuioCursor tcur):
  a cursor was removed from the table
* updateTuioCursor(TuioCursor tcur):
  a cursor is moving on the table surface
* refresh(TuioTime bundleTime):
  this method is called after each bundle,
  use it to repaint your screen for example

Each object or cursor is identified with a unique session ID that is maintained
over its lifetime. Additionally each object carries symbol ID that corresponds
to its attached fiducial marker number. The cursor ID of the cursor object is always
a number in the range of all currently detected cursor blobs.

The TuioObject and TuioCursor references are updated automatically by the TuioClient
and are always referencing to the same instance over the object lifetime.
All the TuioObject and TuioCursor attributes are encapsulated and can be
accessed with methods such as getX(), getY() and getAngle() and so on.
TuioObject and TuioCursor also have some additional convenience methods
for the calculation of distances and angles between objects. The getPath()
method returns a Vector of TuioPoints representing the movement path of the object.

Alternatively the TuioClient class contains some methods for the polling
of the currently visible objects and cursors. There are methods which return
either a list or individual object and cursor objects. The TuioObject and
TuioCursor classes have been added as a container which also can be used
by external classes.

* getTuioObjects() returns a Vector of all currently present TuioObjects
* getTuioCursors() returns a Vector of all currently present TuioCursors
* getTuioObject(long s_id) returns a TuioObject or NULL depending on its presence
* getTuioCursor(long s_id) returns a TuioCursor or NULL depending on its presence
